# RSL (Roblox Styling Language).
A styling language which compiles into a style sheet instance (well a ModuleScript which returns a style sheet). This project was a little 2 day experiment and therefore is not stable.

Requires the `FFlagEnableStylingEverywhere` fflag to enable the experimental style sheets feature in studio.

Change the path in `init.lua` to the path of your RSL file and then run the `init.luau` file via lune.
